[{"title":"How to setup blog?","url":"/2023/07/14/how_to_setup_blog/","content":"GithubJust create a new repo, and the repo’s name follows rule “username.github.io”.\n\nNode.js &amp; HexoInstallJust donwload Node.js from offical website (maybe you also need npm :)). For Mac user, the simplest way is run command:\nbrew install node\n\nFor Hexo, we just need to run\nnpm install hexo-cli -g\n\nAfter installation, use commands to validate:\nnode -vnpm -vhexo -v\n\nInitIf everything is OK, run following commands:\nmkdir blog &amp;&amp; cd bloghexo init   # init the folder as blog reponpm install # install necessary node_modules\n\nThen you will find a file named blog/_config.yml, add these info in last rows:\n# Deployment## Docs: https://hexo.io/docs/one-command-deploymentdeploy:  type: git  repository: &lt;your github repo&gt;  branch: master\n\nDeployYou can add a new plug-in npm i hexo-deployer-git so that we can post blogs to git via hexo.\nhexo new post &quot;this is post name&quot;hexo g  # generatehexo s  # can view changes in localhosthexo d  # deploy to github\n\n\n:money:\nActually this step is optional, cause u can use “username.github.io” to browse your blog. However, if you want a fancy URI (and you are rich), you can follow the step.\n\nYou should buy a web URI, I got one from GoDaddy.\nAfter you got one, let’s say it’s “myfancyblog.com”, you should set the DNS so that when other people enter “myfancyblog.com” in browser, it can re-direct to “username.github.io”.\nOther people                  Your github repo&quot;myfancyblog.com&quot;   - DNS -&gt;  &quot;username.github.io&quot;\n\nIn DNS Management page, you should set two more DNS Records.\n\n\n\nType\nName\nData\n\n\n\nA\n@\nIP Address For username.github.io\n\n\nCNAME\nwww\nusername.github.io\n\n\nThe first one re-directs “myfancyblog.com” to “username.github.io”‘s IP, the second re-directs “www.myfancyblog.com“ to “username.github.io”.\nThen, you should go back to your blog repo, in blog/source create a new file CNAME, then put “myfancyblog.com” in this file. hexo g &amp;&amp; hexo d. You will see github.com will have a new CNAME file, and you can check “Setting -&gt; Pages”, it should have “myfancyblog.com” in “Custom domain” field.\n\nTipsIf you are curious about “why I changed some settings but the web page seems no change”, :(, well, remember to clear the browser cache.\n","tags":["blog"]}]
